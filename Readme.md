# About
Fork of the Adrien Friggeris CV template.

My version is typesetted in [Iwona](http://jmn.pl/en/kurier-i-iwona/) and
[Nanum Brush Script](http://hangeul.naver.com/) for a nifty sub heading. It
uses the roughly the same colours as the original. I also kept the `print`
option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on
light but hope noone really needs it.

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Iwona and Nanum, biblatex
for publications printing if needed and textpos for the aside and fontawesome
for the social media icons in the sidebar.

I also included the font Iwona font archive from
http://jmn.pl/en/kurier-i-iwona/ as Iwona-ttf-0_995.zip.

The bibliography.bib file is just kept for reference but there is no
publication listing in my CV.
